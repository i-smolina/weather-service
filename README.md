# weather-service
Write a REST service with a single endpoint /weather. When called, this service must query a database for today's weather (temperature) in the table "weather_history". If no record is found in the database for the current date, then it must read the current temperature value from page "yandex.ru". After reading temperature, it must insert a new record in "weather_history". In the end, it must return the temperature value back to the user.
